# Unlock
Was the theme of OSU Game Creation Club's September 2024 Mini-Jam, and this buggy bundle of messy code is my submission!

I chose to experiment with procedural geometry and physics in Godot 4.3, and created this as a result. The player can right-click anywhere in the world to create a procedural key, and then test it against a not-fully-implemented lock.

I had a silly idea to integrate this mechanic into a game where the whole world is made of stock images and the player is a grumpy looking old man stock image with watermarks still on him, who must unlock an absurd amount of doors to do basic life tasks, all well grumbling with fully voice acted lines. Because the keys are procedurally created, they could be cut into new shapes as well. I thought another interesting game mechanic could be using a *key cutter* (as a joke about lock cutters) to pick locks by modifying keys that are "close enough".

Anyway, it was a lot of fun, the time crunch was really something with such a busy week, but I'm proud of the small little thing I made.
